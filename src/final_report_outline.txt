**Complaint Clustering for AI Chatbot Strategy (Scenario 3):**
High-volume, repetitive complaints clustered under **'Account Access Issues'** and **'Reliability & Bugs'** are ideal candidates for AI chatbot automation. The chatbot should prioritize:
* **Login/OTP Flow Resolution:** Automated troubleshooting for locked accounts or missing codes.
* **Crash Reporting:** Automatically capture device and app version details when a user reports a crash to accelerate engineering triage (Level 2 Support).
